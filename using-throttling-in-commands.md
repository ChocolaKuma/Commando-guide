# Using Throttling in Commands

Throttling is like rate-limiting, it only allows the command to be used in a certain period of time. A cooldown of sorts. They're very simple, as with most things I've explained in Commando.

Let's \(for the millionth time\) grab our say command's properties.

```js
super(Client, {
    name: 'say',
    aliases: [
        'copycat',
        'repeat',
        'echo',
        'parrot'
    ],
    group: 'group2',
    memberName: 'say',
    description: 'Replies with the text you provide.',
    examples: [';say Hi there!'],
    guildOnly: true,
    args: [{
        key: 'text',
        prompt: 'What text would you like the bot to say?',
        type: 'string'
    }]
});
```

Now, let's add `throttling` to the command. `throttling` is an object, which contains two things:

`usages` is the amount of times the command can be used in the given time period.  
`duration` is the amount of time the cooldown lasts, in seconds.

Let's make it have 2 usages allowed in a 10 second period.

```js
super(Client, {
    name: 'say',
    aliases: [
        'copycat',
        'repeat',
        'echo',
        'parrot'
    ],
    group: 'group2',
    memberName: 'say',
    description: 'Replies with the text you provide.',
    examples: [';say Hi there!'],
    guildOnly: true,
    throttling: {
        usages: 2,
        duration: 10
    },
    args: [{
        key: 'text',
        prompt: 'What text would you like the bot to say?',
        type: 'string'
    }]
});
```

And now the command has a cooldown.
